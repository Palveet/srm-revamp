                    in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without
                    prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
                    permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
